# vimrc

This is my vim configuration, including both themes and custom plugins.

## Installation
Execute the install.sh script. This will create the .vim directory if it doesn't
exist, install Vundle (and all the other plugins specified in the vimrc), and
symlink the plugin and colors directories to the right place, as well as the
vimrc.

## Usage
Just use vim!
